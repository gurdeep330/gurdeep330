### 💫 About Me:
Hey there 👋<br>
I am a bioinformatician 🧬🧑🏻‍💻 in Team [VPE](https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine) at [BioMed X](https://bio.mx/research-teams/artificial-intelligence/team-vpe/) with a strong interest in using computational tools to analyze biological data and gain insights into complex biological systems. I enjoy working collaboratively with interdisciplinary teams to understand biological problems and develop novel approaches to solve them.

Checkout my recent collaborations:
* [raimondilab/precogx](https://github.com/raimondilab/precogx): Develop an ML-guided tool ([PRECOGx](precogx.bioinfo1.sns.it)) to explore GPCR signaling mechanisms with deep protein representations (in collaboration with [Raimondi lab](https://bioinfolab.sns.it/) at SNS, Pisa, Italy)
* [russelllab/spc](https://github.com/russelllab/spc): Perform a [computational analysis](spc.russelllab.org) on entire human proteome to identify potential SPC cleavage sites not associated with signal peptides (in collaboration with [Lemberg lab](https://biochemie-med.uni-koeln.de/en/research/research-groups/lemberg-lab) at Uni-Cologne and [CPB lab](https://www.department.ch.tum.de/cell/home/) at TU Munich)

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any great ideas. I'm always open to hearing new perspectives and collaborating with others.
